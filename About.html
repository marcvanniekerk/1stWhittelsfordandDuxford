                          If you think Scouting’s just about knots, woggles and big shorts, then be prepared to be surprised.
                          There are 450,000 young people in Scouting, spread across five sections: Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts, Explorer Scouts and the Scout Network. Each section has its own balanced programme of activities, badges and awards. It’s how Richard Branson, Barack Obama and David Beckham got their start in life and you can benefit too.
                          <br>
            <br>
                          Adventure is at the heart of everything we do. It is the single most important thing that sets Scouts apart.
                          It’s exciting being involved with us. We believe that through the everyday adventure of Scouting, young people and adult volunteers regularly experience new challenges that enrich their lives and meet life long friends.
                          <br>
            <br>
                          Every young person in Scouting enjoys a balanced range of activities, events and experiences, covering a huge range of activities, from outdoor and physical pursuits to community involvement, creative expression and learning about the wider world.
                          <br>
            <br>
                          Together we help Scouts get the most out of their Scouting experience by including elements from as many zones as possible within the activities on offer. And, the older they get, the more input young people themselves have in their own activity selection, which range from hiking in the dark, travelling across the country with just a backpack and three friends, and spending the first night away from home.
                          <br>
            <br>
                          Activities are an integral part of Scouting. But as well as being challenging physically, our activities help young people set and achieve goals and grow in confidence.
